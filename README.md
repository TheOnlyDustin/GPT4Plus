# GPT4Plus
WIP
<h1 align="center"> This is an attempt to allow GPT4 to access the internet using openai API.
<h2 align="center"> ðŸ’– Help Fund Auto-GPT's Development ðŸ’–</h2>
<p align="center">
If you can spare a coffee, you can help to cover the API costs of developing Auto-GPT and help push the boundaries of fully autonomous AI!
A full day of development can easily cost as much as $20 in API costs, which for a free project is quite limiting.
Your support is greatly appreciated!!
